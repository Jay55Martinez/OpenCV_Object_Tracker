## Description:

In this OpenCV project, I will be creating a robot that will move on a 2-dimensional axis and use object detection and recognition to track and follow objects with a camera. The objective of this project is to become familiar with the OpenCV library and to explore the design process of a personal project. All source code, CAD files, and supporting resources will be part of the repo so that you can follow my design process.

## Built With:

This section will list the libraries and frameworks that I used to complete this project:
Python, OpenCV

## Road Map:
- [ ] Detection Class
- [ ] Tracker Class
- [ ] Servo Class
- [ ] Servo and Detection integration
- [ ] Testing on Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Modeling CAD structure
- [ ] Assembly and Tests
